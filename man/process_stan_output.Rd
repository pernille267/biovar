\usage{
process_stan_output(
  fit,
  log_transformed,
  analyte = "X",
  group = "Y",
  data = NULL,
  digits = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object, typically a \code{list} generated from
\code{rstan::extract}, containing the posterior draws from the Stan model.
It is expected to contain vectors and matrices of draws for parameters
like \code{beta}, \code{sigma_I}, \code{sigma_A}, \code{sigma_G},
\code{df_I}, \code{df_A}, etc.}

\item{log_transformed}{A \code{logical} value. If \code{TRUE}, it assumes the model
was fitted on log-transformed data, and results (like \code{beta}) are
back-transformed. CV calculations are also adjusted accordingly.}

\item{analyte}{A \code{character} string used to label the measurand in the
output tables. Defaults to "X".}

\item{group}{A \code{character} string used to label the group or cohort in
the output tables. Defaults to "Y".}

\item{data}{An optional \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} containing the
original input data. If provided, its \code{SubjectID} column will be used to
label the subjects in the subject-specific output table.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{digits}{An \code{integer} specifying the number of decimal places to use
when formatting the credible intervals. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing three \code{data.table} objects:
\describe{
  \item{Table 1}{A single-row summary table containing the overall model
    estimates, including mean concentration, CVI, CVG, CVA, the distribution
    of the predictive within-subject CV, and the HBHR, all with 95\% credible
    intervals.}
  \item{Table 2}{A subject-specific table showing the individual within-subject
    CV (\code{CV_P(i)}) for each subject, including the mean, median, and 95\%
    credible interval. Subjects are ordered by their median \code{CV_P(i)}.}
  \item{Table 3}{A summary table for the model's degrees of freedom
    parameters (\code{df_I} and \code{df_A}), showing their mean values and 95\%
    credible intervals.}
}
}
\description{
Takes the posterior draws from a Stan model fit and computes key biological
and analytical metrics, such as coefficients of variation (CVs) and credible
intervals, formatting them into user-friendly tables.
}
\details{
This function serves as the primary post-processing step. It calculates the
mean concentration, within-subject CV (\code{CVI}), between-subject CV (\code{CVG}),
and analytical CV (\code{CVA}) from the posterior distributions.
It handles calculations differently depending on whether the model was run on a
log-transformed scale. The function also computes the distribution of the
predictive within-subject CV (\code{dCV_P(i)}) and the heterogeneity of this
distribution (HBHR).

\strong{Important Note on Model Validity:}
The reliability of the metrics produced by this function depends entirely
on the quality and convergence of the Stan model fit. The \code{fit} object is
typically the result of \code{rstan::extract(your_stanfit_object)}. Before
trusting the output of this function, it is essential to perform standard MCMC
diagnostics. Key checks include:
\itemize{
  \item Verifying that there are no divergent transitions after warmup.
  \item Checking for transitions that exceeded the maximum treedepth.
  \item Ensuring that the R-hat (potential scale reduction factor) for all parameters is close to 1.0 (e.g., < 1.01).
  \item Confirming that the effective sample size (\code{n_eff}) is sufficiently large for all parameters of interest.
}
These diagnostics can be checked by inspecting the summary of the original \code{stanfit} object.

\code{\link{plot_subject_specific_CVI}} for visualizing the results.
